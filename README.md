# BackgroundGeneratorJava

Code to create a background grid stored in a custom HashTable from an image. More info is in the [library file](./BackgroundGenerator.java).

> :warning: **The current implementation is slow**: The default java hashmap and hashtable are not meant for this and are incredibly slow. Your custom one will be much, much faster

## Get Started

To use this, copy the BackgroundGenerator.java file into your code and then use it as described.
